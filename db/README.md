# db

[create.sql](https://github.com/tim-tm/spr/tree/main/db/create.sql) contains a few queries to create a table structure and fill it with data.
The entire data is from [w3schools's sql tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_all), credits to them.

also useful:
- on *nix operating systems, you can run a sql-file by piping it into [sqlite3](https://www.sqlite.org/)
  ```sh
  sqlite3 test.db < create.sql
  ```
